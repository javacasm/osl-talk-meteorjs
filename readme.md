> This repository was in origin material to give a talk in the [OSL of the University of Granada](http://osl.ugr.es). Talk hosted by [@JJ](https://github.com/JJ) who had hooked all of us by showing the [power of a commit](https://github.com/JJ/top-github-users-data/issues/2).

> Now the aim is that it is for **you**. To play, learn things about Meteor.js, node.js, JavaSript and whatever you see fit.

> Go have fun already!

# Welcome stranger!

Here you'll find an overview of [Meteor.js](http://www.meteor.com), a platform to build JavaScript applications that uses [node.js](http://nodejs.org) and the browser (or phone) with the same ease.

Quoting their documentation:

>Meteor is an ultra-simple environment for building modern websites. What once took weeks, even with the best tools, now takes hours with Meteor.

## Documentation
### Meteor docs

Meteor has [really good documentation](http://docs.meteor.com). Go check them out.

### node.js docs

Meteor is written in [node.js](http://nodejs.org) server side. So you may find
also useful [nodejs documentation](http://nodejs.org/api),

### node-fibers

Meteor uses [node-fibers](https://github.com/laverdet/node-fibers) to make
asynchronous calls seem synchronous. You will need this if you want to understand
whats going on under the hood.
