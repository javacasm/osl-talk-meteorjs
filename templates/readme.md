# Templates

They are defined in html form using Spacebars, a template language inspirated by [handlerbars](handlebarsjs.com). It has similar syntax but extended capabilities.

The way it works is that any file with a `html` extension will be pre-compiled and sent to the client. Well, not any file with this extension. Files placed at /private or /public will not be treated as such. [Read more about file loading in Meteor](http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/structuringyourapp).
